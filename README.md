# SpamGuard-ML 📧🚫

## Overview 📋

This project in Python employs machine learning techniques that I learned in my IBM machine learning certification. Specifically, it uses logistic regression to detect spam emails. It uses the scikit-learn library for machine learning and the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization method for text data preprocessing.

## Features ✨

- Trains a logistic regression model to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam).
- Uses a CSV file 📄 which contains more than 5500 emails to train the model.
- Utilizes the TF-IDF vectorization technique to transform data into numerical features.
- Evaluates the model's performance on both training and test datasets using accuracy scores 📊 which are printed for the users to see.
- Provides a simple interface to classify a new email as spam or ham based on the input text.

## Dependencies 🛠️

To run this program, you need to have the CSV file I provided in the same folder and also have the following dependencies installed:

- pandas 
- Python 3 
- scikit-learn 
- numpy (usually installed with scikit-learn) 

Or you can use JupyterLite or download the Anaconda software from where you can create a Jupyter Notebook and run the program there.
